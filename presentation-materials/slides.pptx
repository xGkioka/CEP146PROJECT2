Slide 2 – Purpose of the AI Act

Goal: Regulate AI safely and ethically
Key Objectives:

Protect people from harmful or discriminatory AI

Ensure transparency when interacting with AI

Require safety, testing, and high-quality data

Promote ethical, human-centered AI innovation

Create a global model (similar to GDPR)

Slide 3 – AI Risk Categories Overview

Four categories based on risk:

Unacceptable Risk (Banned AI) – e.g., mass surveillance, real-time facial recognition, social-credit scoring

High-Risk AI (Strictly Regulated) – e.g., healthcare diagnostics, hiring algorithms, self-driving vehicles

Limited Risk (Transparency Required) – e.g., chatbots, AI-generated media

Minimal/No-Risk AI – e.g., spam filters, game AI, recommendation systems

Slide 4 – Unacceptable Risk AI

Fully prohibited AI systems

Threaten safety, privacy, or fundamental rights

Examples:

Mass biometric surveillance

Real-time facial recognition in public

Emotion recognition in workplaces or schools

Government social-credit scoring

Manipulative AI targeting vulnerable groups

Slide 5 – High-Risk AI

Allowed but heavily regulated:

Requires audits, documentation, and EU registration

Examples:

Healthcare diagnostic systems

Job application AI

Education scoring/proctoring

Self-driving vehicle systems

Biometric ID & financial loan assessment

Slide 6 – Limited & Minimal Risk AI

Limited Risk:

Users must know they interact with AI

Examples: Chatbots, AI-generated media, virtual assistants

Minimal/No-Risk:

Free to use, no restrictions

Examples: Spam filters, video-game AI, recommendation systems

Slide 7 – Rules for Developers & Companies

Requirements:

Human oversight of AI systems

Unbiased, accurate training data

Clear documentation

Privacy and rights protection

Cybersecurity measures

Notify users for AI-generated content

Penalties:

Up to €35 million or 7% of global annual revenue

Slide 8 – Global Impact

EU AI Act influences worldwide AI policy

Global companies must comply to operate in Europe

Other countries exploring similar regulations (Canada, U.S., Japan, Australia)

Called the “GDPR of AI” for its international impact

Slide 9 – Importance & Criticisms

Why it matters:

Prevents bias, discrimination, and privacy violations

Reduces unsafe AI in critical areas

Promotes responsible innovation

Criticisms:

Could be too strict for startups

Might slow AI adoption

Some definitions are vague (“high-risk”)

Compliance costs can be high

Slide 10 – Conclusion

EU AI Act is the first major AI regulation

Introduces a risk-based framework

Ensures transparency, safety, and ethics

Likely to shape global AI policy for years
