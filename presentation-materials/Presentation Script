Team Presentation Script

🎤 Xenofon (0:00–0:35) — Introduction

“Hello everyone. Today, our team will introduce the EU AI Act, officially adopted in 2024 and entering full implementation in 2025. This Act is considered the world’s first comprehensive and legally binding AI regulation.

Why is it important? Because AI is growing rapidly, and governments worldwide are trying to balance innovation, safety, and human rights. The EU AI Act sets the foundation for how AI should be developed, tested, and used responsibly.

Our presentation will briefly explain how the regulation works, who it affects, and why it matters globally.”

🎤 Rasel (0:35–1:30) — Core Components of the EU AI Act

“The EU AI Act classifies artificial intelligence systems into four risk levels.
	1.	Unacceptable-risk AI
These are banned entirely. Examples include social credit scoring or AI that manipulates vulnerable groups.
	2.	High-risk AI
These systems are allowed but must meet strict safety standards. This includes AI used in healthcare, transportation, employment, education, and law enforcement. Companies must conduct risk assessments, maintain data quality, and ensure human oversight.
	3.	Limited-risk AI
Systems like chatbots must clearly inform users they are interacting with AI.
	4.	Minimal-risk AI
Most everyday tools—like AI filters or game AIs—fall here.

The Act holds companies legally responsible for misuse, discrimination, and harmful outcomes. This is a major shift because many countries still rely on voluntary guidelines instead of laws.”

🎤 Aida (1:30–2:05) — Global Impact

“What makes the EU AI Act unique is its global influence.
Even companies outside Europe must follow the rules if they want to operate in the EU. This is called the Brussels Effect.

As a result:
	•	Big tech companies must redesign some AI models.
	•	Developers need transparency, documentation, and bias testing.
	•	Consumers gain stronger protection against harmful AI decisions.

Many countries—including Canada and the U.S.—are now watching the EU as a model for their own future AI regulations.”

🎤 Sapphire (2:05–2:30) — Conclusion

“In summary, the EU AI Act is the first all-inclusive legal framework that regulates AI based on risk. It aims to protect society while still encouraging innovation.

As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, this Act will shape how companies build AI and how governments worldwide design their own policies. Thank you for listening.
